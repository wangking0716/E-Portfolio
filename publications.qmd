***Raster and Least Cost Path Analysis Using QGIS and ArcGIS Pro***

**QGIS**

-   Rasterize the study area of grizzly bear shapefile using GDAL

    -   The polygons represent Grizzly Bear population units in the Rocky Mountain foothills of Alberta

-   Mosaicked 14 DEM tiles in the region into single raster using GDAL Merge tool.

-   Clipped the single DEM raster to the rasterize grizzly bear study area for further analysis

-   Generate a total cost raster representing cost of movement for grizzly bears

-   The cost factors include:

    -   slope

    -   land cover

    -   road crossing

-   combined these factors using own-defined weights to create cost raster

**ArcGIS Pro:**

-   Perform a least cost path analysis in ArcGIS Pro

    -   define the optimal route for moving between primary and secondary habitats

-   Adding layers created in QGIS:

    -   Total cost raster

    -   DEM of the study area

    -   slope, land cover, roads

    -   primary/ secondary habitats

-   Using Distance Accumulation and Optimal Path as Line tool to create least-cost path between the primary and secondary habitats
